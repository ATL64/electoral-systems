# About

There are around 200 countries in the world, and many of them follow some sort
of democratic process to elect their parliamentary representatives.
However, the electoral process can differ significantly from country to country.
Some countries have a system where only one representative is chosen in each
constituency, whereas others are divided into a few larger constituencies with
different numbers of representatives.
Some countries have a country-level threshold that determines the minimum
percentage of required votes to enter parliament, whereas in other countries the
threshold is set at a regional level - if there is any threshold at all.
Some countries follow the d'Hondt method to distribute the seats once people
have voted, whereas others follow the Sainte-Lague or the Largest Remainder
methods.

It is not clear which system works best in general, but decisions on which
electoral law to follow can have a very direct impact on the final results and
on parliamentary majorities.

This is a tool to visualise the effect that the application of different
electoral laws could have had in past elections. It is important to emphasise
the hypothetical 'could' since, in some cases, different electoral laws might
have forced political parties to follow different strategies.

This tool is currently under development; in the near future we're planning to
improve the visualisation, add metrics, countries and elections. We're also
planning to open-source the code, so that people can contribute if they want to.
We will also publish a guide on how to add new countries to the tool.
